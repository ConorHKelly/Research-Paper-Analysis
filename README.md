# Research-Paper-Analysis
Reading through professor's paper's to determine alignment with accreditation goals. 
This project has goine through a few stages of development, the initial idea began with a program that simply read through a file, finding key words (found from a list of UN Initiatives) and generating a count which could be exported to a csv file. We then began to look into Frequency Distributions, TF -IDF, and Topic Modeling. These concepts gave us new ways to conceptualize the data.
